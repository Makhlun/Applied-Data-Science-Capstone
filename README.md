# Applied DataScience Capstone Project
This repository contains the code and data for the Applied Data Science Capstone Project.<br>
This project was done as the final course for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera.

## Executive Summary 
In this capstone project, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully or not. First of all, we need to collect data. Data was collected using SpaceX API and scrapping. Then we have to deal with missing data. After that, we had to make Data Visualization. Also, we used SQL to show some useful data. Our next step is to show a map of sites. We concluded that all the sites were near the Equator and seacoasts. Then we made interactive plots with Plotly Dash. And the last step is to predict if the stage lands successfully or not using different prediction methods.
